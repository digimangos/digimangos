### Hi there, I'm Damien ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with many things, but mainly GitHub Actions!

With more than 18 years of experience working in technical consulting and software development practice. Currently, I work as a Senior Service Delivery Engineer at GitHub, where I work with a fantastic team, solving unique (and sometimes less unique) problems that are helping customers achieve more! I'm deeply passionate about creating trusted solutions that help others to improve their use of DevSecOps practices.

If you catch me outside of work, I am the Instagram clichÃ© of someone that loves to travel and take photos of food!
